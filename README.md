# Analysis of Ride Patterns and Fare Dynamics in New York City TLC Trips
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze ride patterns and fare dynamics in New York City's yellow and green taxis using the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) trip data. The focus of the analysis is to explore key insights into trip counts, passenger groups, peak hours, fare distributions, and other key metrics. Additionally, it also covers resource allocation optimization insights based on passenger demand and supply imbalance during peak and off-peak hours.
